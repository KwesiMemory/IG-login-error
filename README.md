# IG-login-error
Hi, This issue is frustrating me and on the edge of losing a client. I need HELP. I am not able to get into my clients instagram account for about 3days now. The last time the account was active was December last year. I have tried almost everything to recover the password but not successful. On web, i am told "Sorry we can't send you a link to reset password, contact help on instagram" . Nothing leads me anywhere for solution. The account is linked to its facebook page. I am able to reply messages and comments via facebook but not able to get to the account.  I NEED URGENT HELP.
